    "Engineering activities are focused on building application systems where business logic, architecture, and infrastructure form a coherent and manageable structure. In development, key importance is placed not only on implementing functionality, but also on ensuring the product model remains устойчивость when requirements expand or change.",
    "Practical experience includes designing and implementing web, mobile, and enterprise solutions across various domains: fintech and banking systems, streaming platforms, security systems, logistics, SaaS products, and corporate administrative services. Experience working with solutions requiring high stability, access control, action auditing, real-time data processing, and integration with external services.",
    "Depending on project needs, both modular monolithic architectures and microservices approaches were applied. The use of Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, and event-driven principles for organizing logic enabled structuring the domain model, reducing component coupling, and managing system evolution without compromising its internal integrity.",
    "Experience includes building systems with role-based access control, session management, audit logging, integration of security verification mechanisms, and interaction with external APIs. Priorities include predictable system behavior, controlled change management, and engineering discipline during scaling.",
    "The development approach is grounded in pragmatism and responsibility for the long-term condition of the product: every architectural decision is evaluated in terms of its impact on the future evolution of the system."
