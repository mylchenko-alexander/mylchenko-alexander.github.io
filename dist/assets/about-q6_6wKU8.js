    "Software engineer with commercial development experience since 2005. My core focus and strength lie in building software products from scratch, including architectural design and full-stack implementation. I have hands-on end-to-end development experience and am capable of independently driving a project from technical concept to production release. At the same time, I am most effective within a team model where client communication and requirement management are handled by a project manager or analyst. This approach helps prevent requirement distortion and allows me to fully concentrate on engineering tasks - architecture, implementation, and long-term technical stability of the solution.",
    "I primarily work within Ukrainian engineering teams where clear professional communication and a shared working language are established. In team development, I consider having a unified technical and communication context essential, as it positively impacts solution quality, development speed, and predictability of results.",
    "I work comfortably both independently and as part of structured teams with clearly defined roles and processes. I prefer collaboration models where the company acts as the fully responsible party of the project, ensuring coordination, process support, and accountability for results, rather than shifting managerial or client-facing responsibilities onto developers.",
    "With long-term and continuous experience, I have a broad understanding of web development, modern and well-established technologies, and common architectural approaches. I prefer a pragmatic engineering mindset without unnecessary complexity, focusing on quality, maintainability, and sustainable product evolution."
