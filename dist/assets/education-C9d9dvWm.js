    "My formal education is outside the technical field. I consciously chose professional development in software engineering, as software system development became my primary area of professional realization and has remained one of my key fields of interest for many years.",
    "My engineering foundation was built through early exposure to programming and many years of hands-on practice. My development journey began in the late 1980s on a ZX-Spectrum 48K computer (Basic). During my school years, my interest strengthened on IBM-compatible computers and with the Borland Turbo Pascal language (Graph/Turbo Vision), which expanded my capabilities in algorithms, data structures, and application design principles.",
    "With the beginning of the Windows era, I actively developed solutions using Borland Delphi, creating client-server systems (Interbase/Firebird) and commercial products during the formative period of the IT market in Ukraine. This stage shaped my systems thinking, architectural mindset, and understanding of the full development lifecycle."
